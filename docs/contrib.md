#Bear Contributed Modules
We try to keep the overall size of the bear installation profile as small as possible, but packed with the most amount of features that we use on 90% of our client projects. We have built some additional features and wrote some custom code that doesn't quite get used enough to put into the main bear release. We have moved some of these features and settings to their own bear contributed modules that can be installed on any Drupal website to add these additional features.
