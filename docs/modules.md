# Bear Custom Modules

Bear comes packaged with some custom modules that are designed to speed up the site building process. Like the rest of Bear, you are encouraged to modify these modules as you see fit.

## Bear Paragraphs

[Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs) is a powerful module that is extremely useful in component based approaches to site development. Each Bear Paragraph module includes a preconfigured paragraph bundle and can be enabled via drush (e.g. `drush en bear_paragraph_text_area`) or through the Drupal UI.

To keep them lean and unobtrusive, these paragraph bundles come completely un-styled. Each is completely self-contained and does does not depend on any module other than Paragraphs. More information about each module can be found in the module's `.info.yml` file.
