Feature: New Content Type Settings
  When I create a new content type
  The preview before submitting should be disabled
  And the display author and date should be disabled
  And the revisions should be enabled
  And comments should be hidden
  To make the process of creating new content types more efficient
  And to ensure new content types have the best default settings
